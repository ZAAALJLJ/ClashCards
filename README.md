Clashcards aims to create a  web-based platform that will make learning fun, interactive, and collaborative by incorporating game mechanics into a flashcard system. It solves the boredom of studying alone by transforming learning from passive memorization to active engagement, allowing users to challenge friends or others in a dynamic, social setting. Designed for a wide range of users, the app empowers students to prepare for exams, quizzes, and tests in a fun and competitive way, while educators can create custom flashcard sets to gamify their lessons and develop a collaborative yet challenging classroom experience.
