# ClashCards: Battle of Knowledge


Clashcards aims to create a  web-based platform that will make learning fun, interactive, and collaborative by incorporating game mechanics into a flashcard system. It solves the boredom of studying alone by transforming learning from passive memorization to active engagement, allowing users to challenge friends or others in a dynamic, social setting. Designed for a wide range of users, the app empowers students to prepare for exams, quizzes, and tests in a fun and competitive way, while educators can create custom flashcard sets to gamify their lessons and develop a collaborative yet challenging classroom experience. Even gamers who crave the excitement of competition can enjoy Clashcards by blending their love for gaming with meaningful learning.   Thus, this aims to shift the perception of studying from a routine task to an exciting and rewarding activity.
